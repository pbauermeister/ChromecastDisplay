# ChromecastDisplay

Work-in-progress project, currently does not yet do anything useful.

## Purpose

ChromecastDisplay is an Android app, aimed at displaying what's going
on on nearby Google Chromecast. Especially useful for headless
Chromecast Audio, in order to display music track, volume, paused
state.

It contains a full source copy of
https://github.com/vitalidze/chromecast-java-api-v2 because this
project (which works great, BTW) could not be successfully imported as
lib via gradle.
